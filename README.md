# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer (NST) - Simple Conceptual Demo

**Neural Style Transfer (NST)** is a deep learning technique that blends the **content of one image** with the **artistic style of another**, producing a new image that retains the content structure but adopts the stylistic patterns of the second.

---

## 🧠 What is Neural Style Transfer?

Imagine combining:

- 📷 A photograph of a landscape (**content image**)
- 🖼️ A painting by Van Gogh (**style image**)

Into a new image that looks like a **landscape painted in Van Gogh’s style**.

Traditional NST methods use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** such as **VGG19** to extract and merge content and style features from both images.

## 🧪 What This Program Does

This project is a lightweight, conceptual demo that explains the **core idea of NST** without requiring pre-trained models or external datasets.

### ✔️ Key Features:
1. **Generates two synthetic images**:
   - A **blue circle** (used as the content image)
   - An **orange square** (used as the style image)

2. **Simulates style transfer**:
   - Combines the content and style images by blending pixel values (not real CNN-based NST, but conceptually similar).

3. **Displays the result**:
   - Shows all three images side-by-side for easy visual comparison.

## 🖼️ Output Summary

After running the program, you'll see a 3-image grid:

| Content Image | Style Image | Stylized Output |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Blue circle on white | Orange square on white | Circle shape with both blue and orange blended |

This mimics how style and content features might merge in a real NST pipeline.

## 💾 Output Example

You can download or save the stylized image grid directly from the program output.
